**INTRODUCTION:**

**ChaseIT'nLearn** is a web application will let students (self-paced learners or regular students) enter a class with the topic of their choice. The students will answer each lesson within the chosen topic. After they answer each lesson, the students can accumulate points that can be used to download specific learning materials. For the secondary end-users, which are the teachers, the teachers can create a class where the students can join, and the teachers will assess the students' performance based on the activities or tasks given. The application will earn through ads and the profits will be focused on improving the development of the application to enhance the user experience and sharpen the service.
